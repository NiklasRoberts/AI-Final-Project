PLOT,"Installation divided into 28 plots, each with a 30- by 50-meter treatment area and a 20- by 40-meter interior measurement plot.",,
TREE,Represents the tagnum which has been nailed or stapled to this particular tree on the plot.,,
RECRUIT,"Indicates whether or not this tree was in the original study establishment or if it has grown in since then. If a new tree is found, it is given the tree number of the closest original tree number and the next available recruitment number.",,"0=tree was present and measured at time of study establishment; 1, 2, and so on indicate trees added to file over time primarily due to ingrowth of natural regeneration."
DATE,Date of stem taper measurement,,
SPECIES,Indicates the tree species for that particular tagnum.,,See Code_Species.csv
