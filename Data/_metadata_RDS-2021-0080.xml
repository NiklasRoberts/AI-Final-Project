    <descript>
      <abstract>C55 is a study of thinning and fertilization implemented in a naturally regenerated, high density stand of primarily western redcedar on a low-site quality area on the Olympic Peninsula in western Washington. The fertilization treatments compared effectiveness of urea and ammonium nitrate (2 nitrogen fertilizers) as well as fertilization treatments which included phosphorus, calcium, potassium and sulfur. This data publication contains the response variables, measured between 1980 and 2005, such as tree height and diameter growth, basal area, regeneration, foliar nutrients, stem taper, crown width, branch diameter and regeneration.</abstract>
      <purpose>Western redcedar is an ecologically important and commercially valuable species but relatively little information has been available on its growth rates in young stands or responses to management.</purpose>

    <attracc>
      <attraccr>Measurements were taken by trained, experienced field crews; however, field measurements were not verified unless triggered by data editing programs.</attraccr>
    </attracc>
    <logic>Data were edited for inconsistencies via specialized data summary programs and plotting repeat or related measurements (such as height at time A versus height at time B or tree diameter versus tree height) and field checked if appropriate (e.g., tree height appeared to have shrunk from the previous measurement and a condition code such as dead top was not recorded). Foliar nutrient values included blind duplicates when sending samples for analysis.</logic>
    <complete>Missing data are denoted by blank cells. Also, typically a '0' was also used to denote a missing measurement. Actual missing data were the result of either a tree being missing or human error of omitting the measurement. Some measurements such as heights and height to live crowns were subsampled.</complete>

        <methdesc>STUDY DESIGN
		
A thinning and fertilization trial was established in a young stand of primarily western redcedar on the Olympic Peninsula in western Washington in 1980. The trial consisted of 4 blocks of 7 treatments for a total of 28 plots. Treatment plots were 30 meters (m) x 50 m with interior measurement plots of 20 m by 40 m. Prior to study establishment, stand density was 5900 trees/hectare (ha), predominately 15-20 years old with the largest 250 trees/ha averaging 5.4 m in height. Five treatments reduced stand density to approximately 3 m x 3 m or 1100 trees/ha. Slash from the thinning was left on site. The initial fertilization treatments took place prior to the first growing season of the study (i.e., year 0); a second fertilizer application occurred in year 13. The fertilization treatments in year 0 in thinned stands were two forms of nitrogen (N) (urea or ammonium nitrate), N+P/CA, and N+P/CA+K/S (Table 1 in Harrington and Devine 2011). The N+P/Ca+K/S fertilizer formulation was also applied in the unthinned, fertilized treatment. For the second fertilization application, it was decided to combine some of the treatments to allow for a possible future separation of plots that would compare three fertilizations versus two (the third fertilization has not been done). Thus, at year 13, three plots each from treatments 2 and 3 (thinned plots previously treated with urea or ammonium nitrate) were retreated with ammonium nitrate, and three plots each from treatments 4 and 5 (thinned and previously fertilized with ammonium nitrate and monodicalcium phosphate or ammonium nitrate, monodicalcium phosphate, and potassium sulfate) were fertilized with ammonium nitrate and triple superphosophate. Because four of the plots in one block did not receive the year-13 fertilization, these plots were dropped from statistical analysis, although mean values for these four plots are included in the results as treatment T1N. Fertilizers were applied by hand to treatment plots, using two perpendicular passes, from 26 March through 3 April 1981 (year 0) and from 21 through 29 June 1993 (year 13). Monodicalcium phosphate was selected in year 0 as the P source so that soils would not be acidified by the P fertilization. This formulation was not available for the 1993 fertilization, so triple superphosphate was applied instead.  
            
DATA COLLECTION - TREES
			
After the precommercial thinning treatment, but prior to the year 1 (1981) growing season, all trees on each measurement plot greater than 1.3 m in height were tagged with unique numbers and measured for diameter breast height (dbh) (measured at a height of 1.3 m) and total height. Diameter at breast height of all trees was remeasured after the growing season in years 2, 5, 10, 16, 20, and 25. At each remeasurement, untagged trees (i.e., ingrowth) that were 4.0 cm dbh or greater were tagged, measured, and remeasured in subsequent years. In 1980, 5350 trees were measured, and by study year 25, the total had increased to 8365. There were 24 veglings (trees of vegetative origin, in this case arising from a branch) in the study. Their growth rates were similar to those of trees of seed origin and so they were combined with the trees of seed origin for all analyses.
            
Total height of all initial trees was remeasured in years 2 and 5. In years 10, 16, 20, and 25, height was measured on a subset of trees (approximately 12%) from the full range of diameters present. This subset of trees was composed of the two most prevalent tree species, western redcedar and western hemlock, which together comprised over 97% of trees in the study. Other species were typically in subcanopy crown positions. At the last three measurements, height to live crown (HLC) was also measured on all trees selected for height measurements. In year 25 crown radius was measured in two directions, 180Â° apart, at the widest point of the crown. 
            

DATA COLLECTION - STEM ASSESSMENT
			
Following the year-17 and year-25 growing seasons, stem taper was assessed by measuring stem diameter of randomly selected trees at heights of 0.3, 1.3, 2.3, and 3.3 m using a ladder.  
            
At the time of the year-25 taper measurements, diameters of two branches per tree were measured, at the proximal end, on the same trees measured for taper. These branches were selected by first determining the azimuth of greatest crown diameter and then bisecting the stem vertically using an azimuth offset 90Â° from that of greatest crown diameter. On each of the bisected halves, the largest-diameter branch was selected within 2.3 m of stem base. Branch status (living or dead) was recorded.

Samples of year-10 (i.e., 1990) foliar growth were collected 3-4 April 1991 from 10 dominant or codominant trees per plot. These samples were collected from the upper portion of the crown that was exposed to sunlight. Samples were composited by plot and analyzed for total N, P, K, S, Ca, and Mg. Nitrogen analysis followed the Kjeldahl method.
            

DATA COLLECTION - SOIL
			
Following year 25 (May 2006), mineral soil in the 0 to 20 centimeter (cm) depth interval was sampled using a steel soil probe at eight systematical1y arranged locations per plot. At each location, five subsamples were col1ected, and then al1 samples were composited by plot. Samples were analyzed for pH (1: 1 soil:water, v/v), total C and N (Fisons NA 1500 Elemental Analyzer, Fisons Instruments, Manchester, UK), inorganic N (NIL. and N03; Sims et al. 1995), P (Bray-1 extraction), S04-S (CaP04 extraction), K, and Ca (both via inductively coupled plasma).
